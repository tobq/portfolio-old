         <div class="i">In this game I built, you play a flash-light-like object that can only see within their lit viewport. Players lose by being killed by another's beam of light, and gain points by beaming down others. Players also have a variety of powerups which can be used while their mouse is being held down for a set period of time, before it being regenerated.<br/> The game was built in Javascript, in both the front and back ends, and utilises web sockets for connections between the server and players.</div>
