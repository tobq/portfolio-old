				In this game, you play a flash-light-like object that can only see within their lit viewport. Players lose by being killed by another's beam of light, and gain points by beaming down others. Players also have a variety of auto-regenerating power-ups, which are triggered (and diminished) while their mouse is held down.<br /><span id="note">The game was written in Javascript - both front and back end - and also utilises web sockets for connections between the server and players.</span>
